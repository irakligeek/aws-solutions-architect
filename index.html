        <p class="mt-2">
          I have been working in technology since 2014, specializing in web
          development. Naturally curious and always eager to learn, I thrive on
          exploring new areas of technology. In 2023, I developed a strong
          interest in networking and cloud technologies, leading me to dive into
          cloud computing through online courses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm documenting my journey to showcase the challenges I encounter and
          the solutions I develop along the way. My goal is to become an AWS
          Solutions Architect and an expert in cloud technology. I believe my
          extensive experience in tech will make this transition both smooth and
          efficient.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm passionate about problem-solving and driving business value
          through technology. With strong business acumen and a deep
          understanding of cloud architecture, I aim to help organizations
          optimize their networking infrastructure with cloud solutions.
          Reducing latency and saving costs are just a few perks AWS services
          offer, allowing businesses to focus on their goals and customer
          satisfaction.

                <a href="awssolutionsarchitect.com"
                  >awssolutionsarchitect.com</a
                >
                - hosted on Amazon S3, secured with an SSL certificate from AWS
                Certificate Manager (ACM), and delivered through Amazon
                CloudFront. The site should be accessible via both www and
                non-www domains, with proper DNS configuration using Route 53.
              </p>
              <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Challenges</h4>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li>
                  When creating a new ACM certificate, it remained stuck in
                  "Pending validation" indefinitely.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The certificate wouldn't validate because I had an A record
                  pointing to the CloudFront distribution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensuring the site was accessible via both www and non-www
                  domains was tricky.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Properly routing the static website from an S3 bucket through
                  CloudFront required additional setup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each time I made an update to the site, I had to manually
                  upload the files to the S3 bucket. This process was
                  time-consuming and inefficient, and I wanted to automate it.
                  My goal was to set up a workflow so that whenever I pushed
                  changes to the main branch on GitHub, the changes would be
                  automatically deployed to the S3 bucket. I needed to run the
                  build command and upload the production files to S3 without
                  manual intervention.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Solutions</h4>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li>
                  I added the required CNAME record in Route 53, allowing the
                  certificate to validate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I deleted the A record pointing to CloudFront, and the
                  certificate validated within minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I added both www and non-www versions as alternate domain
                  names in the CloudFront distribution and created an A record
                  in Route 53 pointing the www version to CloudFront.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I set up a dedicated S3 bucket for my static website and
                  routed it through CloudFront.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To automate the deployment process, I created a new GitHub
                  Action that connects to my S3 bucket and uploads the updated
                  production files. First, I created a new IAM user in AWS and
                  granted the necessary permissions to read and write to the S3
                  bucket. Then, I stored the IAM user's credentials as secret
                  variables in GitHub. Finally, I updated the GitHub Action YAML
                  file to use these credentials for authentication. Now, every
                  time I commit and push changes to the main branch in GitHub,
                  the build is automatically run, and the production files are
                  uploaded to the S3 bucket without manual intervention. Easy
                  and efficient! 🚀

                Successfully deployed a static website on S3 with CloudFront for
                content delivery and SSL security via ACM. The site is fully
                accessible through both www and non-www domains, with proper DNS
                configuration in Route 53. This project improved my

                optimized both security and performance. The decoupled
                architecture, with the database in a private subnet and the
                application in a public subnet, ensured robust isolation and
                security, while also enabling seamless communication between
                components. The successful configuration of AWS services allowed
                for automated scaling and load balancing, improving both
                reliability and user experience resulting in an efficient and
                reliable and cost-efficient WordPress hosting solution.

              <p>
                The objective of this project was to build a small serverless
                application using AWS services. By leveraging AWS Lambda,
                DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Cognito for user authentication, the
                app provides users with personalized movie recommendations based
                on TMDb data.

                  Learned a great deal about Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, and
                  DynamoDB to connect these services by creating a seamless
                  integration between each server. I focused on setting up
                  correct IAM user policies and role permissions, ensuring
                  proper communication and security between the services. This
                  allowed me to achieve a fully functional and secure serverless
                  application.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Configured Cognito user pools and added necessary
                  authentication logic in API Gateway, enabling secure access
                  control.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I configured a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically
                  triggers on code pushes to the main branch. It installs
                  dependencies, builds the project, and securely deploys it to
                  AWS S3 by using GitHub environment variables for AWS
                  credentials. This automated the deployment process, reducing
                  manual intervention.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I carefully configured CORS settings in API Gateway to allow
                  necessary origins, headers, and methods. I also ensured that
                  query parameters were correctly passed through to Lambda
                  functions by enabling Lambda proxy integration in API Gateway.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Outcome</h4>
              <p>
                I successfully built a simple yet fully functional serverless
                application using AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway,
                Cognito, and DynamoDB. The app allows users to securely log in,
                and manage their movie watchlists. By integrating these services
                with proper security and IAM configurations, I created a
                cost-effective, scalable solution with no servers to manage. The
                deployment process is also automated through GitHub Actions,
                ensuring seamless updates and maintenance. The app is now
                running efficiently on AWS, with CloudFront providing high
                availability, showcasing the power of serverless architecture.
                In this project I have learned a great deal about serverless
                architecture, its real use cases, and benefits.
